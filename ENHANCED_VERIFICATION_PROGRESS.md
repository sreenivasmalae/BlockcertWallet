# Enhanced Verification Progress Indicators

This document outlines the improvements made to the verification progress indicators in the CredentialDetailsScreen to provide real-time visual feedback during credential verification.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Real-Time Progress Tracking
- Added `currentVerificationStep` state to track which step is currently being processed
- Enhanced verification handler to update progress indicators in real-time
- Added visual feedback for pending, in-progress, completed, and failed states

### 2. Ordered Step Processing
The verification process now follows a predictable order with proper mapping:

```typescript
const orderedSteps = [
  { code: 'format_validation', label: 'Get transaction ID' },
  { code: 'hash_comparison', label: 'Compute local hash' },
  { code: 'merkle_proof_verification', label: 'Fetch remote hash' },
  { code: 'merkle_proof', label: 'Compare hashes' },
  { code: 'merkle_root_verification', label: 'Check Merkle Root' },
  { code: 'receipt_verification', label: 'Check Receipt' },
  { code: 'issuer_verification', label: 'Parse issuer keys' },
  { code: 'signature_verification', label: 'Check Authenticity' },
  { code: 'revocation_verification', label: 'Check Revoked Status' },
  { code: 'expiration_verification', label: 'Check Expiration Date' },
];
```

### 3. Visual State Indicators

#### Timeline Checkpoints
- **Pending**: Gray circle with border
- **In Progress**: Orange spinner dot with loading animation
- **Completed**: Green circle with white checkmark icon
- **Failed**: Red circle with white X icon

#### Timeline Lines
- **Default**: Gray connecting lines between steps
- **Completed**: Green connecting lines for completed sections

#### Text Labels
- **Default**: Gray text for pending steps
- **In Progress**: Orange text with medium font weight
- **Completed**: Dark text with bold font weight
- **Failed**: Red text with bold font weight

### 4. Enhanced Step Matching
Improved algorithm to match verification steps with UI labels:

```typescript
const step = verificationSteps.find(s => {
  const stepCode = s.code.toLowerCase();
  const stepMessage = (s.message || '').toLowerCase();
  return stepInfo.keywords.some(keyword => 
    stepCode.includes(keyword) || stepMessage.includes(keyword)
  ) || stepMessage.includes(stepInfo.label.toLowerCase());
});
```

### 5. Progress Animation
- Added small delays between verification steps (300ms) to show progression
- Animated loading spinner for in-progress states
- Smooth visual transitions between states

### 6. Status Check Section
Enhanced the status check section with:
- Proper progress tracking for revocation and expiration checks
- Visual indicators for each sub-step
- Consistent styling with main timeline

## UI Components

### Verification Modal Structure
```
┌─ Verification Header
├─ Timeline Container
│  ├─ Main Verification Steps (8 steps)
│  ├─ Status Check Section
│  │  ├─ Status Check Header
│  │  └─ Sub-steps (Revocation, Expiration)
│  └─ Completion Section (Success/Failure shield)
└─ Footer with Done Button
```

### Step States
1. **Pending**: Step hasn't been reached yet
2. **In Progress**: Currently processing this step
3. **Completed**: Step finished successfully
4. **Failed**: Step encountered an error

## Benefits

1. **User Experience**: Users can see exactly which step is being processed
2. **Progress Clarity**: Clear visual feedback on verification progress
3. **Error Identification**: Easy to identify which step failed during verification
4. **Professional UI**: Modern timeline design with proper visual hierarchy
5. **Real-time Updates**: Live progress updates during verification process

## Technical Implementation

The enhanced verification uses React state management to track:
- `verificationSteps`: Array of completed verification steps
- `currentVerificationStep`: Index of currently processing step
- `verifying`: Boolean flag for verification in progress
- `finalVerificationResult`: Final result after all steps complete

The UI automatically updates as verification progresses, providing users with immediate visual feedback on the credential verification process.
