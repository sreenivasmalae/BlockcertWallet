# "Host Undefined" Error Fix Summary

## Changes Made to CredentialDetailsScreen.tsx

### 1. **Enhanced Certificate Initialization**
- Added certificate options with fallback DID resolver
- Wrapped initialization in try-catch for better error handling
- Added detailed logging for debugging

```typescript
const certificateOptions = {
  explorerAPIs: [], 
  didResolverUrl: 'https://dev.uniresolver.io/1.0/identifiers/',
};

const certificate = new Certificate(jsonData, certificateOptions);

try {
  await certificate.init();
  console.log('Certificate initialized successfully');
} catch (initError: any) {
  console.error('Certificate initialization error:', initError);
  throw new Error(`Failed to initialize certificate: ${initError.message || 'Unknown error'}`);
}
```

### 2. **Network Connectivity Check**
- Added basic network connectivity test before verification
- Warns if network is unavailable but continues with verification

```typescript
try {
  const response = await fetch('https://www.google.com', { 
    method: 'HEAD'
  });
  console.log('Network connectivity check:', response.ok ? 'OK' : 'Failed');
} catch (networkError) {
  console.warn('Network connectivity warning:', networkError);
}
```

### 3. **Better Verification Error Handling**
- Added specific handling for network/host-related errors
- Improved error messages for users

```typescript
.catch((verifyError: any) => {
  if (verifyError.message && verifyError.message.includes('host')) {
    throw new Error('Network connectivity issue. Please check your internet connection and try again.');
  }
  throw new Error(`Verification failed: ${verifyError.message || 'Unknown verification error'}`);
});
```

### 4. **Certificate Diagnostic Function**
- Added comprehensive certificate structure validation
- Checks for required fields and URL validity
- Provides detailed console logging for debugging

```typescript
const diagnoseCertificate = (jsonData: any) => {
  // Validates certificate structure
  // Checks URL formats
  // Examines blockchain-specific fields
  // Returns validation status
};
```

### 5. **Enhanced Logging**
- Added detailed logging throughout the verification process
- Logs certificate properties for debugging
- Tracks network-related errors specifically

## What These Changes Fix

1. **Network Connectivity Issues**: The error often occurs when the library can't reach blockchain explorers or DID resolvers
2. **Malformed URLs**: Better validation of certificate URLs prevents undefined host errors
3. **Missing Configuration**: Providing fallback DID resolver and explorer configuration
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Users now get meaningful error messages instead of cryptic technical errors

## Testing the Fix

1. **Import a certificate** into your app
2. **Navigate to credential details**
3. **Tap "Re-verify"** and watch the console logs
4. **Check for these log messages**:
   ```
   Network connectivity check: OK
   Certificate data structure: [...]
   === Certificate Diagnostic ===
   Certificate initialized successfully
   ```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Network timeout
**Solution**: Check internet connection, the diagnostic will show network status

### Issue: Malformed certificate
**Solution**: The diagnostic function will identify missing or invalid fields

### Issue: Invalid URLs
**Solution**: Certificate diagnostic checks URL validity and reports issues

### Issue: DID resolution failure
**Solution**: Fallback DID resolver provides alternative resolution path

## Expected Behavior

With these fixes:
- ✅ Better error messages for network issues
- ✅ Graceful handling of malformed certificates  
- ✅ Detailed diagnostic information in console
- ✅ Fallback options for common failures
- ✅ Network connectivity awareness

The verification should now work reliably or provide clear information about why it's failing, eliminating the mysterious "host undefined" error.
